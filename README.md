# PetWebsite
A website I improved to practice my Web Design skills at WGU.
It was an interesting case of deliberately reducing quality to follow precise specs.

The links in this site's pages were made to be opened as a simple local file.
EVERYTHING WILL BREAK if you try to boot it on a live server.
Just open Index.html and explore from there.

You can see a preview of the homepage, here:

As well as a directory page

And even a very basic contact form
